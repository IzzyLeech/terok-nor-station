# Terok Nor Station

# Goal for this Project
My overall goal for my project is to create a fan website for Star Trek Deep Space Nine, where the user of the website can contribute to the development of the website by contributing data about the show. The user will be able to create an account so that they will be able to add, edit and delete information about the site and also be able to interact with other users of the website in the community section. The community section will be an open forum where user can discuss their enjoyment of the show and also give updates, and input on the development of the website. The project will also have a admin-section where the admin can approve or reject request from user to add, edit or delete information from the website.

# Wireframes

I have used Balsamic to develop my wireframes for my website. I initially created the mobile version and then the wireframes and then scalled it up for both tablet and desktop. I only created layout's for page that would require alot of content and would change amongst the different screen sizes. I decide not to include the admin-request page and the approve and reject page as they will stay the same on all page sizes

The wireframes are below:

### [Mobile Wireframe](readmedoc/wireframe/teroknorstationmobile.bmpr)
### [Tablet Wireframe](readmedoc/wireframe/teroknorstationtablet.bmpr)
### [Desktop Wireframe](readmedoc/wireframe/teroknorstationdesktop.bmpr)
